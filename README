# Leeds Grand Mosque Prayer Times to Google Calendar
## Overview

Muslims pray five times a day and often check the prayer times multiple times throughout the day. By making this process more convenient, we can save time and plan our days more effectively around prayers. This project integrates Leeds Grand Mosque prayer times with a public Google Calendar, allowing Muslims to easily add the daily schedule to their personal calendars.

## Features

- Scrapes daily prayer times from the Leeds Grand Mosque website using Beautiful Soup

- Integrates with the Google Calendar API to update events automatically

- Runs daily on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Cloud Functions and Cloud Scheduler

- Provides a public calendar users can subscribe to from any device
